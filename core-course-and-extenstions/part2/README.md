# summary
this part focused on recieving data from a server and making changes to that data base using form element. we used a new hook called useEffect to perfrom side effects. **Axios library**  was used for using HTTP request methods to the server. **JSON-server library** helped us build a RESTful api for our database with zero code. we also covered some topics on JS such as *event loop* and *promise*,including *promise chaining*, which is centeral to modern JS. custom *environment variables* allowed us to store api keys and not to typed them manually in the command line every time we started our app. we briefly learned what *REST api* is and what *resources* are. another topic was on how react re-renders trees and basics of *reconsiliation*, and the nned for *key-attribute* when dealing with items in a list.
we also used *controlled component* and its use in input element. in the last section, we covered adding styles with CSS. the key part in REACT's philosophy is that instead of seperation of content, style, and logic, code is seperated based on conponents. to achieve this, we can use *CSS modules*.
